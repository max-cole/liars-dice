# Liar's Dice League

A Python engine for running Liar's Dice games between algorithmic players. Players compete in a tiered league — submit a PR to join, and a weekly scheduled run plays the games and updates standings (extra runs trigger automatically when a player file changes).

_This project is based on the foundational work and initial implementation by [Zach Austin](https://github.com/zachaustin01)._

Interested in competing? **[Visit the Wiki](https://github.com/after2400/liars-dice/wiki)** — rules, player API, and how to submit a bot. For local dev setup see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How It Works

Two workflows replace the old per-PR game model:

**`register-player.yml`** — triggered when a PR touches `players/`

- Validates the player file (class name matches filename, display name ≤ 25 chars)
- Registers the player in `leaderboard.yaml` at the appropriate entry tier
- Commits the leaderboard update and auto-merges the PR
- No games run immediately

**`run-season.yml`** — cron fires daily at 9am UTC; a guard job decides whether to actually run

- Runs on Mondays (weekly cadence) or when any `players/*.py` file was added/modified in the last 24h; `workflow_dispatch` always runs
- Plays `N_GAMES` (default 1000) games in each active tier, bottom-up: `inactive → L1 → CH → PRM`
- Promotions and relegations are applied between tiers (so a player promoted from L1 can compete in CH the same day)
- Commits the updated leaderboard and posts a summary to the season tracking issue

A tier is skipped if it has fewer than 2 players.

## Tier Structure

Capacities scale with `TOP_N` (repo variable, default 4, max 8):

| Tier     | Capacity    | Notes                                 |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| PRM      | `TOP_N`     | Premier Division — top of the table   |
| CH       | `TOP_N`     | Championship                          |
| L1       | `2 × TOP_N` | League One                            |
| inactive | unlimited   | Plays separately; top player promotes |

**Entry tier:** new players enter the lowest active tier that has capacity (L1 if possible, else CH, else PRM). A player registered mid-day plays in the next scheduled run.

**Promotion / relegation (per season run):**

- Top player in each tier promotes to the tier above
- Bottom player(s) relegate to the tier below
- `times_inactive` increments each time a player is relegated to inactive
