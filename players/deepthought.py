    The original Deep Thought took seven and a half million years to compute
    the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, and the answer turned
    out to be useless without knowing the Question. This Deep Thought is
    faster and more useful: it just watches how many dice you had left the
    last time you bid. Bluff with five dice in hand and it shrugs. Bluff with
    two and it remembers — you, specifically, by name — and starts pricing
    in exactly how much you panic when cornered. Forty-two was never the
    answer. Mostly it's the player to your left who bids big right before
    they lose their last die.
