class Columbo:
    """
    Just one more thing — who opened, and why *that* face?

    Columbo appears to be fumbling through the round like he can't find his
    notepad. He is not fumbling. He already clocked the opener's first bid,
    back-solved their likely holding, and quietly steered every subsequent
    raise away from the faces they're strong on. By the time he says "liar,"
    he's known for three bets.

    Mechanics:
    - Infers opener strength by back-solving their bid quantity against their
      dice count (~70% of expected is a normal opener — anything above signals
      real backing).
    - Penalises those faces when choosing what to raise on.
    - Tracks wild-state per round (1s stop being wild once bid — most players
      forget this; Columbo does not).
    - Blends the caller's bluff rate into a per-opponent call threshold.
