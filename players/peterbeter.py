    There is, scientifically, only one purpose for this bot: dominate Peter
    Griffin. Not Stewie, not Cal, not the rest of the league — Peter, by
    name, on purpose, with a clipboard and a grudge. Turns out Peter's one
    blind spot was never checking whether HIS OWN raise was actually any
    good — he'd raise whatever looked best to the guy across the table and
    just hope it held. Peter Beter does that math too. Freakin' sweet doesn't
    cut it when your opponent's literally also named Peter and also doing
    math now. Roadhouse.
