    Each round, all active players roll their dice in secret. Players take
    turns bidding (quantity, face). A player may call liar instead of bidding,
    triggering a reveal. The loser of each challenge loses one die; a player
    eliminated when they reach 0 dice. Last player standing wins.

    Args:
        players: List of player objects. Each must implement
                 algo(hand, prior_bet, total_dice, bet_history, outcomes) -> Bet | None.
        game_id: Identifier for this game, stored on every bet_history and outcomes entry.
        bet_history: Shared list to append bids to. Created fresh if not provided.
        outcomes: Shared list to append round outcomes to. Created fresh if not provided.
